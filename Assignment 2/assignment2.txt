Approach: Traverse the string from the last character, and move towards the first character.
 While traversing, if a space character is encountered, 
put a NULL in that position and print the remaining string just after the NULL character.
 Repeat this until the loop is over and when the loop ends, 
 print the string, the %s will make the printing of characters until it encounters the first NULL character.
